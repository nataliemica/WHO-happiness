# Analysing world happiness dataset

### About this project
This project was created for me to practice parsing large sets of data from an external source. With this data I have so far focused on exploring the linear correlations of the different categories used from the study.

From this I have found an interesting, if not kind of disappointing, fact:
A country's generosity has a slight negative, and near zero, correlation to GDP per capita, healthy life expectancy, or the relative amount of social care.
